# Streamlit-Chatbot
A demonstration of creating simple UI, using OpenAI API to create a chatbot, and implementing conscious/ethical design choices. The UI is also designed to be accessible and used with only a keyboard. 



*important note* This folder contains all the deliverables for the project.
If you would like to run the python file, you must put in your own OpenAI API key, otherwise the chatbot functionality will not work
place the .streamlit folder in the same filepath as the .py file to make sure the streamlit app will open in dark mode
